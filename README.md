This project was created for my bachelor thesis where I compare Goal Oriented Action Planning with Behaviour Trees.

In this prototype you will have a small survival game where a set number of agents try to survive in a small world. These agents are either controlled by a GOAP system or a Behaviour Tree system. The game was made in Unity.


The original design I used to create my own GOAP system is from Penny de Byl Goal Driven Behaviour. It was heavily modified by me to make my own system, but the first iteration was based on the one from this tutorial.

The design I used for the Behaviour Tree system is from Mina PÃªcheux How to create a simple behaviour tree in Unity/C#. This one is almost exactly the same as the one described in the blog.
